    "** Now that the data is in a data structure, your boss realizes you can start to use it to make decisions.  He asks you to write code that finds the longest 10' wide driveway they can afford for a specified budget. If their budget is too small to build even the smallest driveway, print an appropriate message and print how much more money they will need. If their budget is enough to build the biggest 10' driveway in the table, build that driveway and print how much money is left over. If it's somewhere in the middle, tell them the largest size driveway they can afford. In each case, tell the client the driveway size and how much money is left in their budget. Show that your code works for all three cases (budget less than smallest driveway cost, budget greater than biggest driveway cost, budget somewhere in between. Be sure to run your code!"

Pass these to the function as parameters. Write a second function that prints a table of driveway costs for any range of lengths and widths, with any increment.  Pass two tuples of the form (minimum, maximum, increment) to the function as parameters, one for the width, and one for the length.  Inside the function, you unpack the tuples or use slicing to get the individual values. If you haven't done so already, use f-strings to properly line up the columns in the table. Now test your program and build four different tables of different sizes, one a single driveway (i.e. a one by one table), one a 5 x 5 table, the table from part 3 of this assignment, and a 20 (length) by 4 (width) table.  Other than the part 3 table, choose your own minimums, maximums and increments to get the correct size. \n",
